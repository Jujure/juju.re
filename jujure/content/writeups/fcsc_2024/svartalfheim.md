# Intro

Svartalfheim is a weird reversing challenge. It seems like a simple x64 ELF with
only a few bytes of machine code, but after playing with it, you might notice
some quantum behaviours. The program might be patching itself when you are
not looking at it, so stay alert :eyes:.

## Challenge description

`reverse` | `467 pts` `14 solves` :star::star::star:

```
Trouvez le flag accept√© par le binaire.
```

## Given files

[svartalfheim](/svartalfheim/svartalfheim)


# Writeup


## Overview

Things are already weird without opening up any disassembler:
`file` tells us the the binary is dynamically linked but ldd says otherwise.

```console
$ file svartalfheim
svartalfheim: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV),
dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, no
section header

$ ldd svartalfheim
	not a dynamic executable
```

Here is the decompiled code of the entrypoint.

{{< code file="/static/svartalfheim/main.c" language="c" >}}

Basically, it simply deletes a file named `_` from the current directory, then
re-create it and open it write mode.

The process then dumps itself into the opened file, close it and execve the
dumped file.

Cool so this should do absolutely nothing except calling itself endlessly.

But what if we give it a try:

```console
./svartalfheim
Welcome to Svartalfheim
FCSC{test}
Nope
```

WTF is going on ?


## Quantum binary

So first I wanted a way to see what was happening between each execution.

I patched the `execve` with a breakpoint in the binary.

It will now crash instead of starting itself again and I can inspect the
`_` file before the next instance deletes it.

Here is the diff of the hexdump of the patched binary (breakpoint instead
of execve) with the hexdump of the `_` file after a single execution:

```console
$ diff svartalfheim_breakpointed.hex first_run.hex 
517c517
< 00002040: 0700 0000 0000 0000 e821 0400 0000 0000  .........!......
---
> 00002040: 0700 0000 0000 0000 3037 0400 0000 0000  ........07......
519c519
< 00002060: 0800 0000 0000 0000 3000 0000 0000 0000  ........0.......
---
> 00002060: 0800 0000 0000 0000 6000 0000 0000 0000  ........`.......
```

A total of 3 bytes have changed, so I go check the corresponding addresses
in my decompiler:

{{< image src="/svartalfheim/rela_patched.png" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}

The first two bytes that are patched are the relocation table addr inside
the dynamic table.

The last byte patched is the size of said relocation table.

This means that at the next execution, the program will have different relocations.

Maybe we should take a look at the original relocation table:

{{< image src="/svartalfheim/original_relocs.png" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}

Unusual relocations indeed. So the first one points to the relocation table
address inside the dynamic table and the second one to the relocation table
size, also in the dynamic table, the two values that were patched in the next
binary. We can already guess that the relocation table will be patched at
every execution, running new relocations every time, just like a processor
run instructions and increments its program counter. This might be a
relocation based virtual machine.

## Reloc based virtual machine

### Figuring out the instruction set

So since the relocation table have changed in the next binary, let's open this
one and check the new relocation table:

{{< image src="/svartalfheim/second_relocs.png" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}

Once again we can see relocs pointing to DT_RELA and DT_RELASZ values, but there are also two other addresses that are patched.

When looking them up, we can see that these two addresses are located inside
the symbol table. To be precise, the values of symbol `1` and `2` are patched.

Below is the corresponding symbol table:

{{< image src="/svartalfheim/second_symtab.png" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}

Great so now let's run the binary a second time and inspect the third relocation table.

I will stop on this one a bit longer because it actually contains the entire
instruction set.

But first, what is *really* happening ?

The relocation table holds ... relocations indeed.

Relocations are applied by `ldso` when a process is loaded into memory
(so at `execve`).

Applying a relocation has different effects depending on the relocation type
(denoted in the lower 32 bits of the `info` field of the reloc).

However, most relocation types imply dereferencing the `value` of a symbol (see the above screenshot for an example of the symbol table) and storing it in the relocation address.

The said symbol is denoted by the higher 32 bits of the `info` field of the reloc.

Now let's really look at the third relocation table and run it in our mind:

{{< image src="/svartalfheim/third_relocs.png" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}

The first relocation is of type `0x8`, and has symbol `0x0` (which mean no symbol)

It points to the address of the `value` of symbol `0x5`.

Relocation type `0x8` will simply put its `addend` value at the address pointed by its `addr` field. Thus storing `0xff` in the `0x5` symbol `value`

Basically this relocation is a `mov mem, imm` instruction.

Second relocation is of type `0x1` and symbol `0x1`.

This relocation will take the `value` of symbol `0x1`, add the reloc
`addend` value, and store the result at the relocation `addr`

So it looks like some sorts of `add mem, reg, imm` instruction, considering
symbols as registers.

I'll do the third relocation and we will have the whole instruction set:

The type is `0x5`, symbol `0x1`. It will take the value of the corresponding symbol, dereference it, and store it in the reloc `addr`.

The assembly for this might look like `mov mem, [reg]`

Here we go, that's it, an instruction set of 3 instructions,
there isn't even an instruction to branch or to add two registers together.

Let's write an interpreter for the VM so we can debug it.

### Writing the interpreter

Basically the interpreter will have multiple roles in the analysis:

* Get an execution trace and disassembly of the virtual machine
* Set breakpoints during execution
* Dump process to inspect the patched ELF at any stage easily and fast

{{< code file="/static/svartalfheim/interpreter.py" language="py" >}}

This interpreter stops every time that the VM patches the native code section
of the binary, this way I can stop whenever IO is performed, dump the binary
and analyse it.

The VM patches the native code a total of 7 times:

* Setup a syscall to write the prompt on stdout
* Immediately after, reset the native code to its original content
* Setup a syscall to read the flag from stdin
* Immediately after, reset the native code to its original content
* Setup a syscall to write the flag validation
* Immediately after, reset the native code to its original content
* Setup a syscall to exit the program instead of the `execve` it again

Investigating the third dumped binary will show us the flag address given to `read`, which will allow us to inject it in our interpreter:

{{< image src="/svartalfheim/radare_read.png" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}

The interpreter also builds a disassembled execution trace:

I tried to make it readable as if it was intel assembly.

I added some comments for easier analysis:

* NATIVE CODE LOADING means that this block (a complete run of a single relocation table) has patched the native code section
* The commented hexstring is the data that is being outputed in the destination operand
* PATCHING CODE means that this instruction has a destination address pointing to the next instruction, meaning it is trying to patch its own code
* PATCHING FAR is the same but on an instruction of the same block but not the next one

These were really helpful during analysis to have a reminder to check for code patching.

You might be saying that the example assembly below doesn't correspond to the
instruction set defined above as there was no such instruction as
`add reg, reg, imm`, it is indeed true, but the trick is that every register
are memory mapped (since they are simply symbols in the symtab of the ELF), so a memory deref can actually be a register and my disassembler lifts this.

```console

#End of block
```

### Side channel attempt

My first attempt at a solver was really simple, I thought that maybe the
VM would check bytes one by one.

So I added a method to inject the flag into my interpreter's memory and tried
to bruteforce the first char, watching for the length of the execution trace every time.

But all 256 possible bytes gave the same number of instructions

At this points I was thinking about lifting the code a little more to reduce
the trace size before reading it, but I was in the mood to read 65000+ lines of the same 3 instructions.

## Analysing the execution trace

Just kidding I did not actually read the whole execution trace.

I knew that the flag start with `FCSC{`, so I dumped 2 execution trace:

* One with the flag as `FCSC{test`
* The other one with `HCSC{test`

I put them side by side (`FCSC{` on the left, `HCSC{` on the right), jumped right after the `read` call, and started comparing them, and lifting the code on paper.

{{< image src="/svartalfheim/trace_read.png" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}

I will not show you the whole execution trace to keep your eyes safe, but
the VM starts by a bunch of `mov reg, imm` instructions to initialize some
variables.

And then a fun pattern appears:

### `add mem, reg, reg`

{{< image src="/svartalfheim/add_reg_reg.png" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}

These three instructions together can actually be lifted to `add r13.b, r6, r13`

It is crucial to understand this simple pattern before we continue to how
branching are handled in this VM.

Start by looking the first instruction: it takes the value of `r13`, add 0,
and store it at `0x45a50`. The first thing to notice is that `add mem, reg,
$0x0` is actually equivalent to a `mov mem, reg`, but there is no such
instruction in our instruction set (`mov mem, [reg]` will deref the reg) thus the add instruction trick.

Then if you look the destination address, it points to the the next instruction `addend`. Looking at the comment, we know that the output value is `0x0` on 8 bytes.

So now when we look at the second instruction, it is indeed `add r13, r6,
$0x0`, but said immediate `$0x0` was patched by previous instruction, with the
value of `r13`, even if the instruction add an immediate, in this context,
the immediate was patched with a register. Thus performing a `add mem, reg, reg`

The third instruction simply zeroes out the 7 higher bytes of the `r13`
register, my disassembler did not lift the addresses of the higher bytes of
regs but trust me on this one.

The comment on the second instruction shows us that the addition had a result of `0x1` (64 bits little endian) (`r6` had value 1), so these 3 instructions simply increment `r13`.


### Lookup tables

I skipped a few instructions, all you need to know is that `r3` points
to the first byte of the flag, and that `r12` was initialized with a byte
coming from an array indexed with the same counter as the flag.

{{< image src="/svartalfheim/lut_lookup.png" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}

The first block simply loads the current flag byte in `r11` (`0x46` = `'F'`)
and the second one basically substitutes the byte from the flag based on a lookup table.

The LuT is indexed based on the flag byte and `r12`, which I assume is some
sort of nonce to add the information of the position of the byte in the
flag during the substitution.

Here is a c equivalent I lifted on paper:

```c
uint64_t r12 = nonce[i];
uint64_t r11 = flag[i];
uint64_t r3 = (r11 << 32) + r12;
uint64_t *LuT = 0x49000;
r11 = *(LuT + r3);
```

The next few blocks are not that important, they store the LuTed byte in memory, increment string iterators and decrement size counters

But then comes the one most important code pattern of this VM:

### Branching

{{< image src="/svartalfheim/for.png" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}

These two blocks perform a branch

It essentially is a `test r7, r7; jne mem`

Here is how it works after lifting:

```c
// First block
jump_table = 0x59000;
r4 = jump_table[r7]; // r7 is remaining flag len
// Second block
r1 = r1 + 0x10 - 0xf0 + r4;
// DT_RELA = r1, r1 is the program counter
```

So `0x59000` contains a jump table indexed on the remaining flag size.

Here you can see at instruction `0x46628`, the jump offset is in the comment.

I noticed it changed when `r7` reached 0.

It is essentialy the first `for` loop iterating on the flag, applying lookup
tables on each byte.

### Flag checking

After that there is a really similar block of code, also performing lookups
of some sort I did not really bother to understand (as the ones of the
previous step) because I found a really interesting branch which was not a loop.

I notice a similar pattern than the for loop above, sligthly different but
still some kind of jump table.

What stroke me is that as you can see on the screenshot bellow, it was
the first time in the whole execution trace, that my purposely wrong flag, ran
to a different branch than the one starting with `FCSC{`

{{< image src="/svartalfheim/check.png" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}

What I did not notice at first is that there are two different branchments in
the screenshot (with the jump offsets marked in red). I noticed it quickly and
backported it to my solver.
I do not actually know what is the meaning of these 2 checks regarding the
previous look up tables but all I know is that I needed to hit jump
offset `0x18` twice for a flag byte to be valid.

So I modified my interpreter to add a breakpoint at the addresses marked in red,
check the value moved in `r4` is `0x18`.

And then bruteforced byte by byte:

While bruteforcing the `n`th byte, I need to hit the breakpoint succesfully (with `0x18` in `r4`) `2*n` times. If the breakpoint check fails once then the byte is fucked up.

# Solver

Here is the complete solver code, with the interpreter, correct breakpoints and
bruteforcing
